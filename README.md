# Miscellaneous Scripts (Python)
## This repository is used as a storage for multiple scripts used for a variety of reasons. 

All code is written for my own personal practice and could be improved on in a lot of ways. Please feel free to use any and edit it for your own use!

In all the scripts, there are multiple comments to help guide the way through the code itself, but most of the scripts require user input to help the code run for multiple different computing systems.
